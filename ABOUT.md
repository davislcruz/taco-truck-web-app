# About

Taco Truck Web App brings a slick, bilingual (English ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ | EspaÃ±ol ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½) online-ordering experience to any Mexican restaurant or food truck.

For customers: browse the menu, customize your tacos, pay with Stripe, and watch your order move from received to ready in real time.

For owners: edit menu items, update order status, and view live analytics from one clean dashboard.

Built end-to-end in TypeScript (React + Express + PostgreSQL) and released under the MIT License, it's mobile-first, self-hostable, and ready to rollâ€”just like your tacos. ğŸŒ®
